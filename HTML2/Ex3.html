    <h1>Pancakes</h1>
    <p>Here's a simple recipe for pancakes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Batter:</b>

            In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><b>Mix Wet Ingredients:</b>

            In another bowl, whisk the egg and then add the milk and melted butter or oil. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><b>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</b>

            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. A few lumps in the batter
            are
            okay; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the Griddle or Pan:</b>

            Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to grease the
            surface.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the Pancakes:</b>

            Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and
            the
            edges start to look set, usually 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Flip and Cook:</b>

            Carefully flip the pancake with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes or until golden brown on
            the
            bottom.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b>

            Remove the pancakes from the griddle and serve warm. You can serve them with maple syrup, fresh fruit,
            whipped
            cream, or any other toppings you prefer.</li>
    </ol>
